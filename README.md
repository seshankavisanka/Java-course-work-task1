# CourseWork_SD2

## Description

This Java program simulates a burger store with multiple cashiers and queue operations. The program allows users to view all queues, view empty queues, add customers to a queue, remove a customer from a queue, remove a served customer, view customers sorted in alphabetical order, store program data into a file, load program data from a file, view remaining burgers stock, and add burgers to stock.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you need Java installed on your system. The main class is CourseWork_SD2, which contains the main method.

## How to Use

1. When you run the program, you will see a menu with different options.
2. Enter the number or text corresponding to your choice to perform the desired operation.
3. The program will display the results or ask for additional input depending on the chosen operation.
4. You can exit the program by selecting option 999 or "EXT."

## Cashier Queues

The program simulates three cashiers with different queue lengths:

- Cashier 1: 2 customers
- Cashier 2: 3 customers
- Cashier 3: 5 customers

## Remaining Burgers Stock

The program keeps track of the remaining burgers in stock. If the stock falls below 10, the program will display a low inventory warning.

## Data Storage

The program can store program data into a file named "w1987581.txt" and load data from the same file.
